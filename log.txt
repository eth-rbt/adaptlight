10/06 : realize that it think toggling it on and off each spereately means "blink once" 

To implement:
1. getting a rule to go back
2. get input options
3. 

Some tasks:
1. everytime I press a button it changes to a random color.
2. hold button that will continuously change color until I let go. 

-> give the AI more room to do stuff so it can actually be expressive. 
-> more freedom, more structure, so it is accurate.
