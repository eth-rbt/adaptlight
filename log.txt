./sync_lamp_agent_listener.sh

10/06 : realize that it think toggling it on and off each spereately means "blink once" 

To implement:
1. getting a rule to go back
2. get input options
3. do some algorithmic stuff on states (i.e. random, count)
4. time

Some tasks:
1. everytime I press a button it changes to a random color.
2. hold button that will continuously change color until I let go. 

color, click, color (random)
color, hold, color(r++)
^allowing it to write in symboloic means

-> give the AI more room to do stuff so it can actually be expressive. 
-> more freedom, more structure, so it is accurate. 

note to self, transition is hard coded

maybe the easiert way is to just tell the lamp like, hey this is what the code is doing, these are the things you see and can do,go do it.. ? 

What problem am i actually solving by using the statemachine structure as an intemediatary? 

Note: paramgenerators are reading the states internally, which is fine 


Next: 
werid dynamic lightings
external triggers (time)
transitions based on not buttons 

-> new branch
ability to have llms do stuff themself: new states/new paramGens/new transitions  

fix the param gen equation shit -> theres two parsers now
add conversation id as past stuff



10/20 -> give it full rules so it can delete rules... lets do tool calls.. 
add
delete
set state
set global param
get time.. 

Also add window serials 


when prompted like: click to hold color, it cant change the previous command
