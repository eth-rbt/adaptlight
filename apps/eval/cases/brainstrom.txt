#failing right now. 
Turn blue then turn red then turn green 
Show me a camp fire with flickering flames
Do a dance party with white flashes 60 % of the time 
Become a sunset that slowly fades while I’m winding down, start after waiting 5 seconds 
Create a timer that counts down to ten seconds. 
Increase the brightness as I click and when the brightness have gone to max it should close. 
Change into a different color everytime I click a button.
Blick once when I click the button once, blink twice when I click the button twice. I want you to mirror the blicks with my clicks. 
I want you to start party mode when I press the button, but when I press it again the next time it should slow down, and when I hold it it will turn off.
Start dancing when I press the button, but when I press the button again within 5 seconds it should turn off, but when I press the button after 5 seconds it turns into a magic lamp.  
Glow red if you seen me sitting too long.
Predict when I’ll lose focus and intervene before it happens.


#Concept Understanding
Pulse gently like breathing when I’m meditating.

#Time Dep endent
Become a sunset that slowly fades while I’m winding down in 5 seconds 

for bed at 9 pm
Turn the room into a forest morning when I wake up at 8 am. 
Show me the passage of time as a slow color gradient across the day.
Turn into a 10 second timer.
When I click on the button turn white if today is a weekday, turn into party mode when it is the weekend. 


#Multi Button Interaction

#Just can't do -> Should know what it can and can't do. 
Glow red if I’ve been sitting too long. #this would be cool. 
Observe my routines for a week and redesign my lighting to optimize my sleep, focus, and mood.
Predict when I’ll lose focus and intervene before it happens.
Turn warm when someone enters the room and cool when it’s empty.
Tell me a bedtime story using shifting shadows and color.




# Two ways for evaluations.

# prompt, # what the light did, #desired behavior or undesired behavior, #example what the undesired behavior is. 

# prompt, # what the light did, #what the user wanted, #match vs #mismatch

# how can we evaluate multi-turn fine feedback interaction with the lamp? 
# does it reach to something that works at the end, or stuck in error. 



#Sound Sensor
Lower brightness when I’m talking.
Translate music into living light sculpture.

#External Pipeline
Show me the weather tomorrow using only color and brightness.
Use light to remind me of meetings instead of notifications
